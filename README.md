# internal-pentest-start
Start Script for Any Internal Penetration Test, performs basic enumeration and looks for low hanging fruit.

This script assumes that you have the following dependancies to run. It was designed and run using Kali 2.0

Dependencies

 - Nmap
 - nmapscraper.py by Alton Johnson located at my repository - nmapscraper.py
